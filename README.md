# hell-world
I meant to write hello-world, oh well, this is funnier.

This is a test repository, as we learn how to use Git for Math 651,
a graduate math course at the University of Calgary.
Michael Lamoureux (me) is the professor leading the course.

Following a tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I'm doing everything from the web page http://github.com/mlamoureux , so
I don't have to mess around with the Terminal App, nor with command lines. 
There seems to be no need for the "Github desktop" application.
